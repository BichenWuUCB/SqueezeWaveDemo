    <div><b>Abstract:
      Automatic speech synthesis is a challenging task that is becoming increasingly important as edge devices beginto interact with users through speech.   
      Typical text-to-speech pipelines include a vocoder,  which translatesintermediate audio representations into a waveform. Most existing vocoders are difficult to parallelize, since theyproduce one sample at a time. Recently, (Prenger et al., 2019) proposed WaveGlow, a flow-based feed-forwardvocoder, which can be easily parallelized, but suffers from increased MACs (Multiply-and-Accumulate Operations)over previous models. We present a squeezed version of the WaveGlow vocoder that requires 50x fewer MACSfor inference, with minimal loss in sound quality produced by the resulting model.
